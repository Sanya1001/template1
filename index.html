        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
            The increased availability of data and novel machine learning methods has sparked an interest in taking learning-based and data-driven approaches in many disciplines such as biology, social sciences, cognitive science, finance, and physics. To solve real-world problems, we require  integration of AI learning paradigms to enable the incorporation of expert knowledge, and dealing with uncertainty or complex structures in learning or inference. This, in turn, leads to a long path between formulating the problem and materializing the learning algorithm. The current practice often falls short in addressing it in a principle way and led to experimentation with variety of models and algorithms. While this gap slows down the progress in the AI field, it also makes it less accessible for domain experts outside the field. This problem calls for formalisms and languages which can integrate the existing disciplines in particular the symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches for combining learning and reasoning.
            In this workshop we look the importance of the integrative paradigms from the lens of real-world applications for making AI accessible to domain experts and provide the means for: 1. High-level and declarative expression of the problem (i.e. the user specifies what she wants to achieve rather than how to achieve it), 2. Incorporating prior knowledge(e.g. laws of physics, or certain biological properties), 3. Reasoning over uncertain data/predictions, 4. Dealing with complex structures such as graphs and relations (e.g. to represent a social network or molecule), 5. Modularity, which allows the components of a program to be easily switched or reused.
        </p>
        <!-- <h3>Challenge for domain experts</h3>
        <span>
            However, current technologies offer cumbersome solutions along multiple dimensions. 
            Some of this include, Interaction with messy naturally occurring data; Necessity for 
            extensive programming; Necessity of exploiting various learning paradigms and techniques; 
            and Extensive experimental exploration for model selection, feature selection, parameter 
            tuning due to the lack of theoretical evidence about the effectiveness of various models.
        </span>
        <h3>High-level goal and implied directions</h3>
        <span>
            <p>
                DeLBP workshop aims at highlighting the issues and challenges that arise for having a 
            declarative data driven problem-solving paradigm. This paradigm facilitates and simplifies 
            the design and the development of intelligent real world applications that consider 
            learning from data and reasoning based on knowledge. It highlights the challenges in 
            making machine learning accessible to various domain experts and application programmers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conventional programming languages have not been primarily designed to offer help for the 
            above-mentioned challenges. To Achieve the DeLBP goals there is a need to go beyond designing 
            tools for classic machine learning new innovative abstractions and enriching the existing solutions 
            and frameworks with the capabilities in:
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifying the requirements of the application at a high abstraction level; 
                Exploiting the expert knowledge in learning; Dealing with uncertainty in data 
                and knowledge in various layers of the application program; Using representations 
                that support flexible relational feature engineering; Using representations that 
                support flexible reasoning and structure learning; Ability to reuse, combining and 
                chaining models and perform flexible inference on complex models or pipelines of 
                decision making; Integrating a range of learning and inference algorithms; Closing 
                the loop of moving from data to knowledge and exploiting knowledge to generate data; 
                and finally having a unified programming environment to design application programs.
            </p>
        </span>
        <h3>Related communities</h3>
        <span>
            Over the last few years the research community has tried to address these problems 
            from multiple perspectives, most notably various approaches based on Probabilistic 
            programming (PP), Logical Programming (LP), Constrained Conditional models (CCM) and 
            other integrated paradigms such as Probabilistic Logical Programming (PLP) and Statistical 
            relational learning (SRL). These paradigms and related languages aim at learning over 
            probabilistic structures and exploiting knowledge in learning. Moreover, in the recent 
            years several Deep Learning tools have created easy to use abstractions for programming 
            model configurations for deep architectures. We aim at motivating the need for further 
            research toward a unified framework in this area based on the above mentioned key existing 
            paradigms as well as other related research such as First-order query languages, database 
            management systems (DBMS), deductive databases (DDB), hybrid optimization and deep 
            architectures for learning from data and knowledge. We are interested in connecting these 
            ideas towards developing a Declarative Learning Based Programming Paradigm and investigate 
            the required type of languages, representations and computational models to support such a 
            paradigm.
        </span>
        <h3>Highlight</h3>
        <span>
            Though the theme of this workshop remains generic as in the past versions, we will 
            aim at emphasizing on ideas and opinions regarding conceptual representations of deep 
            learning architectures that connect various computational units to the semantics of 
            declarative data and knowledge representations. We also encourage submissions on learning 
            to learn programs.
